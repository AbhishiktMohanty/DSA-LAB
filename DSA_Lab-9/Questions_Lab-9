1. WAP to read an array of integers and search for an element using linear search.

2. WAP to read an array of integers and search for an element using binary search.

3. Given an array “container[]” and integer “hunt”. WAP to find whether “hunt” is present in 
container[] or not. If present, then triple the value of “hunt” and search again. Repeat these
steps until “hunt” is not found. Finally return the value of “hunt”.

Input : container[] = {1, 2, 3} and hunt = 1 then Output : 9
Explanation: Start with hunt = 1. Since it is present in array, it becomes 3.
Now 3 is present in array and hence hunt becomes 9 . Since 9 is not present,
program returns 9.
